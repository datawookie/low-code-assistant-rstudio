Accelerate routine data science tasks and smoothly interface with the Domino API through the LCA point-and-click GUI.

## Installation

### Method 1: Installing in a Domino RStudio workspace

Run the following command inside RStudio:

```r
remotes::install_github("dominodatalab/low-code-assistant-rstudio")
```

This will install *LCA for R* in your current workspace, but the tool will not persist once the workspace is stopped. 

*Note: If you encounter an error that includes "Timeout was reached", please make sure that you've selected a harware tier for your Domino Workspace that allows egress. Otherwise, your Workspace will not be able to reach GitHub to download this package.*

### Method 2: Installing in a Domino Compute environment (Recommended)

1. Click on "Environments" on the side navigation bar
2. Select the environment in which *LCA for R* should be installed
3. Click the "Edit Definition" button to allow you to make changes
4. Add the following line to the end of the Dockerfile section (but **before** the last `USER ubuntu` command):

  ```
  RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('dominodatalab/low-code-assistant-rstudio', upgrade = 'always')"
  ```

5. Click the "Build" button at the bottom of the page

This will install *LCA for R* in every workspace that uses the given Domino environment.

### Method 3: Installing from source (Advanced)

If you're in a situation where you cannot run `remotes::install_github()` because your environment won't allow you to connect to GitHub, you can install LCA *from source*. To install from source:

1. Clone this Git repository to any computer that has access to GitHub and has R installed (eg. `git clone <URL>`)
2. Open an R session inside the root of this project (eg. `cd low-code-assistant-rstudio`)
3. Make sure the {devtools} R package is installed: `install.packages("devtools")`
4. Build the package: `devtools::build()`
5. This should have created a file named `assistDomino_<version>.tar.gz` in the parent directory. Copy this file to your Domino project.
6. In Domino, you can now use this file to install: `remotes::install_local("path/to/assistDomino_<version>.tar.gz")`

## How to run

In RStudio, click the "Addins" menu.

Under the heading of "ASSISTDOMINO" there will be a few buttons, one for each of the LCA modules: "LCA Data Selector", "LCA Data Transformation", "LCA Data Visualization". Click on any of the LCA modules to launch them.

> If you installed using Method 1 and you don't see the LCA menus, you may need to click on the *Session* menu and choose *Terminate R* in order for RStudio to refresh.

### Development

When developing/testing, it's useful to add `DOMINO_USER_API_KEY` and `DOMINO_API_HOST` environment variables (eg. using `.Renviron` file).
